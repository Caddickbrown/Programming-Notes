<!--Svelte-->
<!--Svelte is used to build user interfaces for Web Apps. It transforms "Framework code" into "Framework-less" JavaScript. Svelte has its own compiler, converting app code into client-side Java script at compile time. It is usually interpreted at run time.
Svelte apps are built of single-file components using .html. The application requires no dependencies to start as it compiles to vanilla JavaScript at the building stage. It's architected to be faster than a library.-->
	
<!--Installation of Svelte-->
<!--Install:
	- Node.js - a runtime environment needed to execute a JavaScript Program.
	- NPM (Node Package Manager) - an application and repo for developing and sharing JavaScript code.
	- Svelte Project Template.-->
