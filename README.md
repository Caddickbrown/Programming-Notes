# Programming-Notes
These are my notes on Programming Languages as I learn them and pick them up.

They can be used as a reference guide or as a tutorial on their own.

Any suggestions are always welcome - if you have any feel free to drop me a message on Twitter: [@caddickbrown](https://twitter.com/caddickbrown)
