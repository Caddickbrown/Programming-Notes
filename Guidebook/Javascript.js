//Introduction
/*Javascript tends to be used to make interactive webpages.
It's main motto is "Make it Move" and tries to bring "Life" to a webpage with interactions. It has nothing to do with the Java language - and although the names are similar - they do not work the same.
It is responsible for animations across the page and is a part of the following: Search boxes, Videos, Live blogs/scores/updates.
It can be used to create iOS, Android, Web Apps (Interactive Web Pages), or games. It's also used to create fully fledged Desktop Apps. It's one of the most universal languages in that basically anything can be built with it.*/

//Comments
//Single Line - Use "//"
/*Multi-Line - Use "/*" to start. This is the start of a multi line comment
This is the end of the same multi line comment.*/

document.write("Hello World"); //This will print "Hello World", it starts with the command - ends with a semi-colon.

//Variables
//Declaring a Variable
//Strings
var stringy = "Hello World";
document.write(x,x); // The output would be "Hello WorldHello World"

//Booleans
var I_am_Awesome = true; //No need for quotations as it isn't a string.

//Numbers
var age = 27; //JS is a case sensitive language so another variable could be made as "Age"
var nodecimals = 10;
var withdecimals = 10.59; //Numbers can have decimals and are fine without. No need for quotations.
