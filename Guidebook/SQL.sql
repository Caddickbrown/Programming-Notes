--Introduction
--SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used for communicating with a database. It is the standard language for Relational Databases

--Single Line - Use "--"

--DBMS
/*The DBMS (Database Management System) manages the Database (Collection of Data files). It is the "Librarian" to the "Library of Data" and helps manage and organise everything efficiently.
The DBMS is a collection of programs which enable users to:
  - Create a Database
  - Access the Database
  - Manipulate the Data
  - Protect and Secure the Data within the Database

An RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) contains tables of information which have a relation between different tables.
A program can be both DBMS and RDBMS - as long as it can store data in files and tables.

Tables contain Rows (/Records) and Columns. Columns define the Data that the Rows under it must hold.*/

--Entity Relationship (ER)
/*Entity Relationship (ER) is the structured representation of a database with the help of a diagram.
An Entity can be a place, person, object with a conceptual existence (college, job, course etc.), etc.
If "Student" is the "Entity", then "Student ID, Name, Age, etc. would be the "Attributes" describing the Entity.
First identify the Entity, Use an ER Diagram to define the Attributes before converting the diagram to a table. ER Diagrams are purely for reference and enable better planning of data management.
ER Diagrams are just a visual representation of the database used by designers.

ER Diagrams are used to identify:
  - Entity - A Larger block about which you want to store data (Employee)
  - Attributes - A column name and the fields that fall under it (Employee I.D., Job Title, Start Date etc.)
  - Relationships - The link between 2 tables*/

--Attributes
/*Attributes are the properties of the Entity, and the "Variables" of each entry.*/

--Super Sets vs Sub-Sets
/*All tables under the RDBMS are interrelated.*/
