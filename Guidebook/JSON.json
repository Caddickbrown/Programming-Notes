"_comment": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data representation format. Commonly used for APIs and Config files. It's lightweight and easy to read and write, and integrates well with JavaScript as is just a ''superset'' of JavaScript. It integrates easily with most languages."

JSON files don't support comments. All the content in the JSON file is data. If, however, you still want to add a comment to a JSON file, You can use the data part as the comment. Which can be ignored during the processing of JSON file.

Types:

Strings: "Hello World!" "Fred"
Numbers 10  1.5 -30 1.2e10
Booleans true false
null null
Arrays [1, 2, 3] ["Hello", "World"]
Objects {"key": "value"} {"age": 30}

First thing need to do - create .json file.
Insider take one of types and put into file. Usually have Arrays within the file.
