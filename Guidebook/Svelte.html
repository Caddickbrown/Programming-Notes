<!--Svelte-->
<!--Svelte is used to build user interfaces for Web Apps. It transforms "Framework code" into "Framework-less" JavaScript. Svelte has its own compiler, converting app code into client-side Java script at compile time. It is usually interpreted at run time.
The application requires no dependencies to start as it compiles to vanilla JavaScript at the building stage-->
