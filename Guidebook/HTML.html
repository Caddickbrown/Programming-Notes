<!--Introduction-->
<!--HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed within a web browser. It can be enhanced with other languages such as CSS or JavaScript.
	
	It isn't exactly a programming language, but is more of a formatting language. It controls presentation, structure, and layout of the data on a website. It doesn't contain any functional programming logic.

	It won't manipulate data or anything, and won't perform tasks  like event handling, taking inputs and diplaying outputs etc.-->

<!--Comments-->
<!--Single Line and Multi-Line - Use "<!- -" (with no spaces) to start and end in "- ->" (with no spaces). This is the start of a comment
This is the end of the same comment.-->

<!--Start-->
<!--An HTML document consists of 2 parts:

 - Document Creation (What users see).
 - Tags (How they see it).-->

<!--Each tag is written in lower case, opens and then closes out. For instance, for every opening <html> - there is a closing </html> -->
<html> <!-- This is considered the "head of the family" - it tells the browser that it's about to read an HTML document.-->

<head>	<!--This is not displayed on the webpage but it comprises of the title of the browser window or any other instructions that are supplied to the web browser.-->
	<title> Welcome to the Jungle! </title> <!-- This is the Title of the webpage. -->
</head>

<body> <!-- this follows the head tag, this is where the visible content of the website is written. This could h=be headings, paragraphs, images etc. -->
	We got fun 'n' Games!
</body>

</html>

<!--Web Servers-->
<!--A Web Server can be Hardware or Software that delivers the webpage to a browser. The Browser then reads and decodes the instructions. It then displays the content on screen (as the web page).-->

<!--Tags-->
<!--Here are some different tags tat can be used. Below is an example of how they would be used as well.-->
	<p> </p> <!--Paragraph - this is placed inside the body tag and allows you to have a new paragraph.-->
	<br> <!--This allows for a line break - which moves the text onto the next line. It closes by itself and doesn't require a closing tag.-->
	<h1> </h1> <!--This is a Heading tag. It can go upto h6 to display as a heading.-->
	<b> </b> <!--Bold-->
	<i> </i> <!--Italics-->
	<u> </u> <!--Underline-->
	
	<body>
		We got everything you want.
		<p>Honey we know the names!<br>Next line of the song
		</p>
		<h1> This is a Heading 1 </h1>
		<h2> This is a Heading 2 </h2>
		<h3> This is a Heading 3 </h3>
		<h4> This is a Heading 4 </h4>
		<h5> This is a Heading 5 </h5>
		<h6> This is a Heading 6 </h6>
		<p> <b> BOLD </b> </p>
		<p> <i> italics </i> </p>
		<p> <u> Underlined </u> </p>
	</body>
	
	<!-- Putting one tag inside another is known as "Nesting" -->
